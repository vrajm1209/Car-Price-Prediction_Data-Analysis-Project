This is a comprehensive Data Analysis Project from scratch about predicting Car Prices based on given features

As a part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certification, I had worked from sratch on an extensive Data Analysis Project on the Car Pricing Dataset provided. This notebook is part of a 4 part Jupyter Notebook series focusing on the intensive work done on this Data Analysis problem.

1. Data Wrangling - data cleaning, data imputation, data pre-processing
2. Exploratory data analysis - includes statistical anlaysis and graphical analysis
3. Model development and model evaluation
4. Model evaluation and model refinement/tuning
